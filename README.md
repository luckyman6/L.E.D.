# L.E.D - "Lucky Exfiltration Data"

A payload to exfiltrate browsers history files and upload them into the attacker Dropbox Folder.

## Description

Since the primary payload only starts a WIN + R console which will override the security execution commands prevention in Powershell, you will have to upload the file named LED.ps1 to your dropbox, and insert the link in the payload.txt file properly as the payload indicates.

After the command is executed and the LED.ps1 script launches, the files in the Directories listed in LED.ps1 will be uploaded automatically to your Dropbox Folder.
(Attention: You must have a developer account in Dropbox which allow you to insert the uploading token to the API folder where the exfiltrated files will be uploaded.
You can find information on this easily online.)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
